This is a collection of code snippets I may have done for a number of different reasons:

- To share some code.
- To try something (new) and see whether it works and how, like code, tools, languages, features in them, etc.
- To keep a recipe or small fragment of code somewhere.
- To make some small exercise (usually considered to be a programming kata).
- To pass some time for entertainment and amusement.

Basically this is a collection of gists, but instead of keeping them at https://gist.github.com/jmora, since that does
not provide tagging capabilities I decided to keep them here in a single repository, this allows using directories to
keep them sorted. Versioning control is slightly worse when mixing all these things, but I hope not to make changes in
most of them once they are finished, so hopefully this won't be too messy.  If gist implemented some system for folders
or tags I'd switch back to that for the snippets from that point on.
